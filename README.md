  üçã Neural Network Trading Bot üçã 
</h1>

## üëã Introduction 

This is a public [lemon.markets](https://lemon.markets) repository that demonstrates a simple implementation of  
a deep learning trading bot with Tensorflow and the lemon.markets API.
Based on your preference you can trade with a dense neural network or a LSTM neural network using our pre-built functions 
(and tweak hyperparameters in models.py to be whatever you want)!

To get a general understanding of the API, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.lemon.markets).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start
Not interested in reading a novella before you get started? We get it! To get this project up and running quickly, here's what you need to do:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Sign up to [lemon.markets](https://www.lemon.markets/)!
3. Configure your environment variables as outlined in the 'Configuration' section!
4. Take a look at the functions in models.py and backtest.py!
5. Create a directory named data for the get_data methods to write to and read from!
5. Run the code & see how it performs! 


## üîå API Usage
This project uses the [lemon.markets API](https://www.lemon.markets/en-de/for-developers) and the lemon.markets Python SDK.

lemon.markets is a brokerage API by developers for developers that allows you to build your own experience at the stock market. 
We will use the Market Data API and Trading API to train a neural network and set it up to make paper trades in this project!

If you do not have a lemon.markets account yet, you can sign up at [lemon.markets](https://www.lemon.markets/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script uses several environment variables, configure your .env file as follows:

| ENV Variable    |               Explanation               |
|-----------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| DATA_API_KEY    |        Your market data API key         |
| TRADING_API_KEY |    Your paper/money trading API key     |


## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Heroku
If you are interested in hosting this project in the cloud, 
we suggest that you use Heroku to do so. To make the hosting 
work, you need to create a new project and connect 
your GitHub repo. You can find a good explanation [here](https://dev.to/josylad/how-to-deploy-a-python-script-or-bot-to-heroku-in-5-minutes-9dp).
Additionally, you need to specify the environment variables
through Heroku directly. You can do so by either using:

```
heroku config:set [KEY_NAME=value ‚Ä¶]
```
or by adding them in your project in the Heroku Dashboard under 
/Settings/Config Vars. 

Use this button to deploy to Heroku directly.
